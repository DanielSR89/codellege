                This year is shaping up to be phenomenal for the video game industry, as players have gobbled up new content.

                Total consumer spending on games in the U.S. was up 40% in the first half of 2018 to $19.5 billion, according to The NPD Group. The majority of that surge came from spending on game software (including mobile), which totaled $16.9 billion in that time. Mobile games saw the biggest growth, the group says.
                
                Spending on video game hardware hit a seven-year high, thanks to Microsoft’s Xbox One and Nintendo’s Super NES Classic Edition, surging 21% to $1.7 billion during the first six months. (Hardware spending traditionally ramps up during the holiday period.)
                
                Among the games having the biggest financial impact this year are Fortnite, Activision’s Candy Crush, Ubisoft’s Far Cry 5 (the best-selling console game of the year as of early July), and Sony’s God of War.
